        Touch Typing
    </h2>
    <p>
        I started learning touch-typing at eight years old when I was in grade 2. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I love it so much because it makes me faster at a computer. It also showed me that I can learn anything with enought practice. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I love teaching touch-typing as well. Because I want everyone to be just as good as I am. 

        I have taught so many people touch-typing including The First Swiss Astronaunt <b>Claude Nicollier</b>

        BBC Documentary
    </h2>
    <p>
        I was featured in a BBC documentary about young girls in technology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result I got a chance to fly to Laussane, Switzerland for its premier on the 13th. 
        
    </p>
    <p>
        My trip to Laussane was so fun. I felt famous. Everyone refered to me as the Logitech star.
